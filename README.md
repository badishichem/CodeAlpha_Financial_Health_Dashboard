# CodeAlpha_Financial_Health_Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project delivers a fully interactive Financial Health Dashboard built in Power BI as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics internship. The dashboard analyzes key financial indicators, including income, expenses, savings, loans, credit score, and financial ratios to assess the economic stability of individuals. It visualizes income statements, loan structures, debt-to-income risk levels, savings capacity, and demographic patterns through dynamic charts and KPIs. The solution enables users to explore trends, evaluate financial performance, and derive actionable insights for budgeting, risk assessment, and financial planning.
